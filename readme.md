# Spook - a Code Hard or Code Home initiative

## Description

*Don't let your hackathon be haunted by ghostly hackers: a data-driven solution to ensure your sign ups don't drop dead.*

We are an app built to guide your signed up hackers from sign-up to attendance on the day. We provide team challenges, a countdown and a points reward system to help *ghostbust* your event and make dropouts a thing of the past.

### Features

**Daily challenges** in the app to prepare your hackers. e.g.
* multiple choice coding questions
* prompts to set up a whatsApp group, introduce yourself
* read a link to an educational resources on git, agile ceremonies, presenting, etc.

**Group chat in-app** to get teams talking: let's banish paranormal activity by getting the GC going! Engendering community in advance of the event can help ease nerves inspire enthusiasm.
